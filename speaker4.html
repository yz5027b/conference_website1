			<p class="context">Zoë Tiberius Quinn (born 1987) is an American video game developer, programmer, writer, and artist. She developed the interactive fiction Depression Quest, a Twine game released on Steam. In 2014, a blog post by her ex-boyfriend sparked the Gamergate controversy, in which Quinn was subject to extensive harassment.</P>
			
    		
<p class="context">At the age of 24, Quinn moved to Canada and made her first foray into video game programming. Her first game was the result of a six-week course on video-game creation that she attended after seeing an advertisement in a newspaper. In a later interview for The New Yorker, she said, "I felt like I'd found my calling." </p>




<p class="context">She will talk about the relationship between comic art and development of video games.
